# Required Fields from Intents (CyclOps Intent Human Interface (IHU) Module)

- This is the repository of the API of the Required Fields needed by the NLP Chat and the Info Retrieval components of the IHU.

- The API is hosted on: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/tissadeking/ihu_fields/fields. ​

- The Required Fields can be accessed through a get request which returns the general format of the structured intents with empty values, and also the structured intents for the four use cases with example values assigned to the fields.​

- These Required Fields are needed by the NLP Chat to guide its conversation with the user and also ensure that relevant information is captured in the conversation.

- The Info Retrieval makes use of the Required Fields to extract relevant information from the conversation between the user and the NLP Chat and also convert this relevant information to structured intent.
  
- There are use cases example queries listed here: https://everisgroup.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/cyclops/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5031EA4E-BDF7-4628-997C-78C46FF6A86E%7D&file=Use%20Cases%20Request%20Examples%20(NLP%20Chat).xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true.​

- Structured intents for the example queries above have been crafted.​

- These example queries and their corresponding structured intents with Required Fields are contained in the folder ‘use_cases_examples’ in this repository.

- An example of an analytical intent format is found inside the folder 'analytical_intents'.
